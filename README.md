# Interactive Website

## Overview

This is a modern, fully responsive sample website demonstrating multiple advanced interactive components and UI/UX features including:

- **Interactive Animated Button**  
  A visually engaging button with smooth animations and accessible focus styles that enhances user interaction.

- **Link Hover Previews**  
  Embedded links in the text provide on-hover preview tooltips displaying brief multimedia previews and descriptions of each linked page, improving user navigational experience.

- **3D Product Configurator**  
  An immersive 3D model viewer that allows basic color customization of the model within the webpage using controls, powered by Google's `<model-viewer>` web component.

- **Auto-playing 4K Video**  
  A visually stunning, optimized 4K video implementation that autoplays muted and loops seamlessly, contributing dynamic background content.

- **Animated Picture Gallery / Picture Flow**  
  A horizontally scrollable gallery featuring high-quality images with smooth animations and hover effects to create an interactive and stylish visual display.

## Features and Technologies Used

- **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript** for structure, styling, and interactivity.
- Responsive design principles optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Advanced CSS effects: gradients, smooth transitions, shadows, and scaling for engaging UI.
- Accessibility considerations including keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes.
- `<model-viewer>` Web Component for 3D model rendering with camera controls and auto-rotation.
- Embedded multimedia previews (image, video, GIF, PDF) on link hover.
- Autoplaying video optimized for modern browsers with fallback sources.
- External high-quality images sourced via Unsplash and openly licensed resources.
- Color pickers that customize visual presentation of the 3D model appearance.
- Semantic HTML and ARIA roles for better SEO and screen reader compatibility.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. Explore the interactive button, hover over the embedded links to see previews, experiment with the 3D model colors, watch the autoplay video, and browse the animated gallery.

## Notes

- The 3D configurator uses a publicly available glTF 3D model (astronaut) from modelviewer.dev.
- The embedded PDF preview uses an external dummy PDF file hosted by W3.org.
- The autoplay video demonstration uses sample videos from Mozilla Developer Network examples.
- Review and replace media URLs with your own assets if deploying for production.
- No backend or server is required; the website runs entirely client-side.
